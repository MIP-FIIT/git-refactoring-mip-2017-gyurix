## Features ##
- **Animation API** (make your animations and run them easily)
- **Anti Item hack** (never allow your players to give theirselves pre enchanted items, which can be dangerous, i.e. Server crasher nametags, Creative kill potions, OP armour and swords, Command blocks)
- **Anti Book hack** (never allow your players to hack too long or colored name for their books, or to add special JSON tags, like /op commands executed, when an admin clicks in them)
- **Anti Sign hack** (never allow your players to make colored signs without permission, or to add special JSON tags to them, and also limit the number of maximum allowed characters in sings)
- **ChatAPI** (for sending Action bar, Chat and System JSON messages really easy, using my really simple custom format)
- **CommandAPI** (make command simulations easily using this API. It provides commands like Title, Subtitle, ActionBar, Console, Chat, Message, e.t.c. And every command is executed through the VariableAPI, so you can also use variables in the commands)
- **ConnectionLog** (To see every incoming ping and login request from any kind of players, doesn't madder, if the player is banned or not. Might cause spam on usage of BungeeCord, AnimatedMotd, server list sites, that's why this feature is toggleable)
- **Configuration management** (easy serialization/deserialization for any kind of simple or complex object)
- **Language based join, leave and kick messages** (also, with a required permission to see, them, so with this plugin, you can deny seeing these messages for normal players)
- **Language management API** (per player selectable languages)
- **Nbt API** (get, list and add custom NBT tags for entities and items)
- **TitleAPI** (for setting Titles/Subtitles, for players without version incompatibility)
- **PacketAPI** (I have created a brand new API for managing packets really easily and compatible between different Spigot versions)
WITH SERVERBOUND PACKET WRAPPER SUPPORT
- **ScoreboardAPI** (manage per player NO FLICKER sidebars, tabbars and nametag bars easily)
